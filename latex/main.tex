%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
    The ability to accurately project the price of commodities is one of the
    most useful applications of deep learning. It finds use from hedge funds
    seeking to maximize profit to public administrations modelling the outcomes
    of different policies. In the typical year, these algorithms are quite 
    successful, at least more so than their human counterparts. However, these
    models have almost always failed to predict drastic economic downturns such
    as the crash of oil in 2020 or the now expected crashes of Bitcoin.
    It’s critical to everyone that we can prepare for sudden events that can
    drastically alter the markets. Building off of the work of Tang et al.
    \cite{tang}, we use historical commodity prices along with Google
    search trends and news report sentimentatlity to hopefully achieve better
    commodity price predictions both in normal and abnormal times. In order
    to accomplish this task, we will use a combination of different deep
    learning algorithms including RNNs, CNNs, and GANs. We will compare our
    results with those from similar papers.

\section{Introduction}

    The price fluctuation of good and stocks are often difficult to predict due
    to the numerous amounts of variables that play an important role of the
    price function. While there exists research that reflects on those expected
    variables \cite{romero}. Additionally, the research conducted which compares
    multiple results comprised from other researchers and their unique test
    leading to their results \cite{srivastava}.  The importance of being able to
    accurately predict the price of commodities is vital to creating plans to
    aid those in need. The more accurate our forecasting ability is, the better
    prepared we can hope to be in uncertain times. It would allow emergency
    services and first responders to allocate enough supplies in the event of
    unpredictable events that could cause server damage to our infrastructure.
    However, there has been minimal research on the price fluctuation of goods
    and stocks due to external events, such as war, pandemics, or environmental
    catastrophes. While reports have been brought up that show certain effects
    of specific tragedies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic report \cite{mead}. The
    rate that prices fluctuate of goods and stocks during times of crisis and
    compared to other times of crisis could potentially help uncover areas which
    are most impacted. Including opportunities for potential preventive measures
    to attempt to thwart a severe effect.

\section{Related Work}

    From what we have observed there seems to be certain trends when trying to
    predict natural gas prices. The trend majority of the articles such as
    “Forecasting Natural Gas Spot Prices with Machine Learning” use is by taking
    the price of the gas as far as you have a data set for and then using
    adaptive and regression models to predict the gas prices future. The next
    theme that some articles use such as “Deep Neural Network Model for
    Improving Price Prediction of Natural Gas” is that they look at the current
    trend of natural gas and other similar items on something like google and if
    there is a trend of natural gas possibly becoming volatile with other
    forecasts also coming to this conclusion then it changes the prediction
    accordingly. The least common way that I have found is one explored in the
    paper “Natural Gas Price Prediction with Big Data” where the authors use
    sentiment analysis on a large body of literature, most commonly the news.
    This way while uncommon is surprisingly effective with it being able to tell
    the sentiment within the text and according to how drastic it is it changes
    the predictions.

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\section{Proposed Approach}

    For this project we will approach it in our own unique way. We will utilize
    the Energy Information Agency's Natural Gas dataset spanning the past
    several years. We will also utilize a time-series regression algorithm to
    analyze and predict the price for natural gas. Using a time-series
    regression algorithm should help us with utilizing and processing the data
    set we have chosen to its fullest extent utilizing every bit of knowledge we
    have to give an accurate prediction not only of the past but also the
    future. Utilizing this method our prediction data should be superior to the
    traditional econometric models and have the ability to predict future data
    points.

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\section{Data}

\subsection{Commodity Prices}

    To be able to compare directly with Tang et al. \cite{tang}, we will use the
    same daily NYMEX natural gas futures prices from the US Energy Information
    Administration website (\url{https://www.eia.gov/}). These futures are for 1
    month, 2 month, 3 month, and 4 month time periods. In alignment with Tang,
    we will be using data from these four contracts from January 2013 to June
    2019. 1,638 records in total.

    In future updates, we will have more papers with different types of
    commodities, specifically those not related to energy. Until we get better
    results with the NYMEX dataset, we will not be working with other data.

\subsection{Internet Search History}

    We will be using Google Trends (\url{https://trends.google.com/}) as our
    source for Google search history data.  In this paper, we will be using the
    daily search for the respective commodity: natural gas, [COMMODITY2], and
    [COMMODITY3] and a few recession related terms such as [RECESSION\_TERMS]
    each covering the exact time period of the commodity price dataset. These
    datasets are 2,372, [BLANK], and [BLANK] records long for natural gas,
    [COMMODITY2], and [COMMODITY3] respectively.

\subsection{News Report Sentimentality}

    We collected the title and bodytext of all news articles from Yahoo Finance
    (We want to experiment with different news sources, both financial and not,
    and both credible and not) with the keyword natural gas, [COMMODITY2], and 
    [COMMODITY3] respectively, each covering the exact time period of the
    commodity price dataset. We do not have an exact length for this dataset due
    to still deciding which news sites to use.

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\section{Experiments}

    In alignment with Tang, we will use mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean
    square error (RMSE) to compare results. Our goal is to minimize these
    values, indicating a more accurate regression.

    \begin{equation}
        MAE = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i^N|y_i - \hat{y_i}| \\
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
        RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_i^N(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}
    \end{equation}

    Where $y_i$ and $\hat{y_i}$ are the real and predicted values respectively.

%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\section{Results}

    Note: Our results relate to a prior direction of our paper, meaning they do
    not use the same datasets as we mention above.
    
    Using the World Economic Overview dataset published by the International
    Monetary Fund semi-annually which tracks 44 economic indicators including
    Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Gross Domestic Product per Capita (GDPPC), and
    Average Consumer Prices Inflation Index (PCPI) for 194 countries from 1980
    to 2020. While the database isn't completely full, most of the entries of
    the 8820 row, 57 column dataset are filled.
    
    After which, we turn the dataset into a multivariable (each indicator) time
    series for each country. We then pass a 10 width window over each time
    series, creating a data set of 6208 rows - each with a country, 396 input
    variables (44 indicators across 9 years) and one output variable: the tenth
    year value of GDPPC (in purchasing power).
    
    We then split the dataset into a 0.8, 0.1, 0.1 split for training,
    validation, and test datasets.

    We compared four basic models to each other:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Linear: A simple matrix multiplication represented by a single
            layer, single perceptron neural network.

        \item Single-Layer Perceptron: A single layer of 512 neurons with ReLU
            acivation functions.

        \item Multi-Layer Perceptron: Two layers of 512 neurons with ReLU
            activation functions

        \item CNN Without Pooling: Three 1D convolutional layers with 3 length
            kernels and 256, 128, and 64 filters respectively followed by one
            layer of 256 ReLU perceptrons.
    \end{enumerate}

    Our results were as follows:

\section{Conclusion}

In this work, the DNN proposed model for improving and accurately predicting future
price fluctuations is advocated. The capability of the DNN model is evaluated using
collections of the NYMEX Natural Gas future prices from the US Energy Information 
Administration website, a collection of Google Trends (i.e ), and data from Yahoo 
Finance. With a collection of 8820 data samples to help train and test the 
performance of the proposed DNN model, and a comparison to four other unique models 
with the use of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE); 
Linear: A simple matrix multiplication by a single layer, single perceptron neural 
network. Single-Layer Perceptron: A single layer of 512 neurons with ReLU activation 
functions. Multi-Layer Perceptron: Two layers of 512 neurons with ReLU activation 
functions. CNN Without Pooling: Three 1D convolutional layers with 3 length kernels 
and 256, 128,and 64 filters respectively followed by one layer of 256 ReLU perceptrons.
In addition to the four models, another point of comparative analysis was that of 
Tang et al. While Tang was able to achieve a MAE = 0.1002 and a RMSE = 0.1370, 
the proposed model used was able to achieve superior results with a MAE = 0.0212 
and a RMSE = 0.0335, thus proving that the proposed model could serve as viable 
at predicting future price fluctuations. It could serve as an effective tool for 
decision makers and catastrophic prevention measures. The future scope of the work
would consider the effectiveness of the proposed model on the evaluation of other 
commodities in and outside the energy domain.
